# Sign-language-detection

# Description
A deep learning model to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) letters. This system processes hand gestures and classifies them into 29 categories, including A-Z, space, delete, and nothing.

# Features
Preprocessed images using data augmentation techniques like rescaling, rotation, and flipping.
Built a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers for robust feature extraction.
Achieved high accuracy through model optimization and validation.

# Key Technologies
Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, CNN, ImageDataGenerator

#  Output
A trained model capable of real-time sign language recognition.
